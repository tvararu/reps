reps
====

**reps** is a mobile web app that I built in literally 5 minutes to count the number of reps in my current set of exercises. I tried searching for a native Android app but everything was either too complex, wanted my money, had too many features or generally didn't appeal to my extremely simple need.

Deployed at [reps.vararu.org](http://reps.vararu.org/).

Features
===
- increment the counter
- reset it to 0
- fat finger friendly UX so you can use it while working out
- nothing else.
