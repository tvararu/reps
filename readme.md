reps
====

**reps** is a mobile web app that I built to count the number of reps in a set of exercises. I tried searching for a native mobile app but they were too complex, wanted my money, had too many features or generally didn't appeal to my extremely simple need. I decided that simply whipping up my own solution was faster than continuing the search.

Features
===
- increment the counter;
- reset it to 0;
- fat finger friendly UX so you can use it while working out;
- nothing else.
