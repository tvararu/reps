reps
====

**reps** is a mobile web app that I built in literally 5 minutes to count the number of reps in my current set of exercises. I tried searching for a native Android app but everything was either too complex, wanted my money, had too many features or generally didn't appeal to my extremely simple need.

Deployed at [reps.meteor.com](http://reps.meteor.com/).

Features
===
- increment the counter
- reset it to 0
- big ugly buttons so I can fat finger them while I'm doing my exercises
- nothing else.
